      <h2>Installation and access </h2>
      <h3>Can I install MerMEId on my laptop?<a name="laptop_installation"></a></h3>
      <p>In principle, yes. Please note, however, that MerMEId is a web application, not a desktop
        application. This means that it needs a web server to run; the user interacts with MerMEId
        through a web browser. It also means that installation requires the skills of a system
        administrator to set up all the components of the web server. Technically, it is possible to
        do it on a laptop, but usually that's not advisable, because your installation and your data
        wouldn't be accessible from any other machine. Also, if your laptop crashes or is stolen,
        you are likely to lose your data. Installation on a proper web server located at your
        institution gives you much better data protection, and not least: You will be able to use
        MerMEId and access your data from any computer that has access to your server. All you need
        is a web browser. </p>
      <h3>Is there a simple installation container available?<a name="installation_container"
        ></a></h3>
      <p>Not yet. We're working on it.</p>
      <h3>Can I use The Royal Danish Library's MerMEId server for our project?<a name="kb_hosting"
        ></a>
      </h3>
      <p>Unfortunately no. The Royal Danish Library's demo installation at <a
          href="http://labs.kb.dk/editor/" target="_blank">labs.kb.dk/editor/</a> is meant for
        demonstration only. The library cannot host other projects' data. You are welcome, on the
        other hand, to use the demo installation to try out MerMEId or even to do preliminary work
        until you have set up your own server. Note, however, that the library does not take any
        responsibility for any loss of data stored on the demo server. The data at the demo server
        are freely accessible for anyone to edit or even delete. If you are doing any serious work
        there, make sure to make local copies of your data frequently (See: <a href="#copying_data"
          >How do I copy or move my data</a> from one MerMEId instance to another?). We are also
        likely to clean up the server by deleting user data every now and then. If there is
        something you would like us not to delete please let us know. </p>
      <h3>How many MerMEId installations do I need for my project?<a name="number_of_installations"
        ></a>
      </h3>
      <p>Preferably only one. MerMEId is a web application (See: <a href="#laptop_installation">Can
          I install MerMEId on my laptop?</a>), and your data will need to be stored on the same
        server. If you have more than one installation, you will have trouble synchronizing your
        data across MerMEId intances (probably by copying files back and forth manually). </p>
      <h3>How do I copy or move my data from one MerMEId instance to another?<a name="copying_data"
        ></a>
      </h3>
      <p>To move or copy XML data files from one MerMEId installation to another, download your
        files to your hard drive first. You can do so one file at a time by right-clicking (on
        Windows machines) the file's XML icon in the file list and selecting "Save as..." or
        equivalent. If you need to download many files it will probably be easier to use the eXist
        database's admin client. You will need to have administrator access to the database in order
        to use it. You will probably find the adminstration page at
        http://[yourservername.yourdomain]:8080/exist/. Click the 'Collections' option to open the
        database's file manager which allows you to download all or some of your files. You will
        find your files in the 'dcm' folder. Use the same component on another server to upload your
        data (again, to the 'dcm' folder). </p>
      <h3>What if some day MerMEId is no longer maintained? Will I lose my data?<a
          name="discontinuation"></a></h3>
      <p>No. One of the core ideas of MerMEId is that it produces data compliant to the <a
          href="http://www.music-encoding.org">MEI</a> XML schema – an open, well-documented
        standard for encoding musical information. Basically, MerMEId is simply a user interface to
        allow you to produce MEI XML without having to hand-code everything. You can use other tools
        such as a generic XML editor to do the same, just in a less convenient way. So even without
        MerMEId, you can still have valid MEI XML data and continue your work using other tools.
        Just make sure always to keep a copy of your data somewhere safe. </p>
      <h3>How do I know which MerMEId version is running on my server?<a name="version"></a></h3>
      <p>To see the version (revision) number of your installation, open any file in the editor (or
        create a new one) and click the <img src="../images/mermeid_12px.png" alt="MerMEId logo" />
        logo in the lower right corner.</p>
      <h2>HTML preview and presentation of data </h2>
      <h3>Can I change the way MerMEId displays my data?<a name="changing_presentation"></a></h3>
      <p>Yes, you can. MerMEId's basic MEI-to-HTML XSL style sheet, mei_to_html.xsl, is located in
        the eXist database (in db/style/). By modifying it you may alter the way MerMEId displays
        your data, or you can make a copy of it to use for your presentation outside of MerMEId. You
        may also want to download and/or alter the corresponding CSS style sheet, mei_to_html.css,
        found in the same location.<br /> If you want to switch between different transformations,
        you can place custom XSL style sheets in the eXist database (in db/style/) and tell MerMEId
        which transformation to use by adding a parameter ?xsl=[your xsl file name] to the preview
        URL, like: http://www.example.com/storage/present.xq?xsl=your_style_sheet.xsl<br /> Even
        though MerMEId can produce HTML to display your data (either by clicking a work's title in
        the file list or by clicking the 'View as HTML' icon in the editor), MerMEId does not tell
        you how to present your data to the public or in any other context. The built-in HTML
        preview is meant for reviewing your data for convenient proofreading etc. <br /> You are
        welcome to re-use or alter the XSL style sheet used to create the preview for your public
        presentation, but more likely you will want to define your own. There is no forced
        connection between the way MerMEIds displays your data and the way your final presentation
        does. In the public version of the <a href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html" target="_blank"
          >Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works (CNW)</a>, we are using a slightly modified version of
        MerMEId's HTML preview XSL style sheet to do the basic formatting; we have basically just
        filtered out certain information and linked to a different CSS style sheet.</p>
      <h3>Can I change the language of the HTML output?<a name="html_language"></a></h3>
      <p>MerMEId adds a number of pre-defined labels and phrases (such as 'Performances', 'Sources'
        etc.) when generating the HTML page. By default, these are in English. You may temporarily
        override the default by adding <kbd>&amp;language=[language identifier]</kbd> to the URL of
        the HTML preview – for instance, <a
          href="http://labs.kb.dk/storage/present.xq?doc=nielsen_cnw0130.xml&amp;language=de"
          target="_blank"
          >http://labs.kb.dk/storage/present.xq?doc=nielsen_cnw0130.xml&amp;language=de</a>.<br />
        Of course changing the language does not affect any text you have entered in the editor. You
        can permanently change the HTML view's default language by editing the default_language
        variable at the beginning of the <kbd>mei_to_html.xsl</kbd> file located in eXist (in the
          <kbd>db/style/</kbd> folder). MerMEId currently comes with English (en), German (de) and
        Danish (da) translations. These are stored in the <kbd>db/style/language/</kbd> folder in
        eXist. </p>
      <h3>MerMEId does not show some information I have entered. Why?<a name="information_not_shown"
        ></a>
      </h3>
      <p>The built-in HTML preview is designed to display all the information you may enter in the
        editor, with a few exceptions. Some information is very complex to handle; for instance,
        only some of the possible relations between sources, versions etc. are pre-defined to have a
        visible effect in the HTML preview. If you want other relations to have a an effect, you
        will have to define it in your presentation. Finally, there is definitely a chance that we
        have simply forgotten to implement a certain feature in the HTML preview because we haven't
        used it yet. Please let us know if something is missing. </p>
      <h3>Will MerMEId render any music encoded in my files?<a name="render_score"></a></h3>
      <p>Encoded music may appear in two different places in your MEI files: Incipits encoded in the
        header, and any music (score) encoded in the MEI file's main music section (the
        &lt;music&gt; element).</p>
      <p>MerMEId comes with a <a href="http://labs.kb.dk/storage/present.xq?doc=incipit_demo.xml"
          >demo file</a> to illustrate different ways of including incipits. Encoded incipits are
        rendered using the <a href="verovio.org" target="_blank">Verovio</a> MEI renderer.</p>
      <p>By default, MerMEId also renders any music encoded in the main music part of the document –
        or at least the beginning of it. This rendering also uses <a href="verovio.org"
          target="_blank">Verovio</a>. You may deactivate it temporarily by adding
        '&amp;score=false' to the URL of MerMEId's HTML presentation. To turn it off permanently,
        change the value of the variable 'view_score' to 'false' in the the MEI-to-HTML
        transformation (the file <kbd>mei_to_html.xsl</kbd>). This reverses the behaviour: you may
        then activate rendering temporarily by adding the parameter '&amp;score=true' to the
        URL.</p>
      <h2>Using the editor </h2>
      <h3>How do I start a new file collection or catalogue?<a name="start_a_collection"></a>
      </h3>
      <p>You may have noticed the use of 'Collection' names in MerMEId's file list, for instance,
        'MerMEId Demo'. The collection names are intended to enable you to distinguish or select
        files belonging to a certain catalogue in your database. This makes it possible to have any
        number of catalogues in the same database. To make your file part of a specific catalogue or
        collection, open the file in the editor, go to the 'File' tab, and enter the collection name
        in the field labeled 'File Collection' under 'Series' (and save your work, of course). In
        the file list, you will now see the collection name in the 'Collection' column, and it will
        also appear in the collection drop-down list, allowing you to search for files in that
        collection only.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3>How do I make MerMEId recognize a certain number as a catalogue work number?<a
          name="add_work_number"></a></h3>
      <p>You may have noticed that the demo files in MerMEId's file list are labeled like'MerMEId
        Demo 3' in the 'Collection' column. To make MerMEId recognize a number as the work's or
        file's number in your collection (equivalent to the numbers in the BWV, for instance), go to
        the 'Work' tab, add a work identifier (under 'Identifier'), enter the file collection's name
        as the list name and the desired number in the 'No.' field. If MerMEId finds a work
        identifier corresponding to the file collection defined at the 'File' tab, it regards the
        identifier's number as the catalogue number.</p>
      <h3>Is there a way to do a 'search and replace' in all of my files?<a name="batch_transform"
        ></a></h3>
      <p>Yes, but you will need to know how to write an XSLT style sheet to do it. MerMEId provides
        a script transforming all (or some) of your data. This allows you to do simple text
        replacements but also complex structural changes. See <a href="batch_transform.html">Batch
          transforming XML files in the database</a>.</p>
      <h2>Customizing the MerMEId editor</h2>
      <h3>Can I add fields to the editor form or alter existing ones?<a name="customize"></a></h3>
      <p>In principle yes, if you know how to write <a href="http://www.orbeon.com/" target="_blank"
          >Orbeon XForms</a>. You will find the MerMEId source code at <a
          href="https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You
        are free to change it to make your&nbsp;customized version of MerMEId. However, note that
        this will require you to make the same changes again after installing one of
        our&nbsp;MerMEId updates. Also, MerMEId is based on sharing. No one else will&nbsp;benefit
        from your changes if you keep them for yourself. Therefore we would like to encourage you to
        share your improvements either by forking the code at GitHub and submitting a pull request
        or to discuss your wishes with us; if we agree that the changes will be of general interest,
        we may be willing to implement them if&nbsp;we have the time. Another possibility is&nbsp;to
        pay us (that is, the <a href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/">Danish Centre for Music
          Editing</a> at the Royal Library) to make the desired improvements. That's a great way to
        support the MerMEId project.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>I don't want MerMEId to create change log entries automatically. Can I turn it off?<a
          name="automatic_log"></a></h3>
      <p>In MerMEId's configuration file <kbd>mermeid_configuration.xml</kbd> there's an option to
        turn off the automatic logging of changes. <br /> This is also where you can entirely
        deactivate advanced features such as the <a href="attribute_editor.html">attribute
          editor</a> and the <a href="code_inspector.html">code inspector</a>. </p>
      <h3>Can I change the pre-defined instrument names and codes?<a name="customize_instruments"></a></h3>
      <p>Yes. If you only want to change the displayed instrument name in a few cases, the simplest way is 
        to manually change the text MerMEId inserts in every instance. 
        The more efficient way - and the only way, if you also want to change 
        the available standard code values – is to change the lists of instrument and ensemble names
        kept in the eXist database. They are located in a folder named <a href="/storage/library/"><kbd>library</kbd></a> 
        together with other customizable lists.
        The instrument and ensemble names are stored in three separate files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>instruments.xml:      </kbd> A general reference list of individual instrument names and codes</li>
        <li><kbd>ensembles.xml:        </kbd> A general reference list of ensemble names and codes</li>
        <li><kbd>instrument_groups.xml:</kbd> A selection of pre-defined ensembles or instrument groups including some instruments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The file <kbd>instrument_groups.xml</kbd> is the one populating the menu popping up when clicking an 
        "Add ensemble" button; it is intended to provide an easy way of entering some fairly standardized 
        instrumentations quickly. Of course, the elements inserted from the menu can be adjusted afterwards
        to have the desired instrument numbers and names.<br/>
        MerMEId comes with two different sets of instrument and ensemble definitions: One according to MARC and
        one according to UNIMARC standards. They are also located in eXist's <a href="/storage/library/"><kbd>library</kbd></a> 
        folder and have "_marc" and "_unimarc" added to their file names, respectively. MerMEId looks for the files without the indication of
        standard, i.e. <kbd>instruments.xml</kbd>, <kbd>ensembles.xml</kbd> and <kbd>instrument_groups.xml</kbd>,
        so to change from using the MARC lists (default) to using UNIMARC, simply rename the files accordingly.<br/>
        If you are not familiar with eXist, ask your system administrator about how to access and 
        edit the files. 
      </p>
      <h3>Which standard should I use for instrument codes and names? MARC or UNIMARC?</h3>
      <p>        
        MerMEId comes with two pre-defined sets lists of instruments and ensembles (see above): 
        One containing the instruments defined as part of the MARC cataloguing standard (default), 
        and one containing the much more detailed UNIMARC list of instruments.<br/>
        Which one to use is up to you. 
        The use pupose of using standard codes for instruments is to optimize machine-readability and 
        data interchange. In some cases, a very precise coding may be desirable (in that case, use UNIMARC), 
        in other cases it is sufficient to have codes just describing the instrumentation roughly 
        (in that case, use MARC).<br/>
        Please note that the displayed <i>names</i> of the instruments and
        ensembles are independent of the codes used, so you can change the names to whatever you want. 
        For instance, some would prefer using Italian terms for instruments, other would use English terms. 
        Some prefer abbreviations, others prefer full names. <br/>
        This means that your <i>naming</i> of instruments can be as detailed as you like, even if you choose
        the limited MARC instrument codes. 
        <i>Example: While an oboe and an oboe d'amore would get two different codes in UNIMARC 
          (<kbd>wob</kbd> and <kbd>woa</kbd>, respectively),
        they would both be assigned the code <kbd>wb</kbd> (for oboe) when using MARC; still, they may be named 
        precisely ("oboe" and "oboe d'amore", respectively) in the instrument name field in both cases.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>The authority file I use is not listed. Can I add it?<a name="add_authorities"></a></h3>
      <p>Yes. You can edit the list the same way you would <a href="faq.html#customize_instruments"
          >change pre-defined instruments names</a>. Look for the file <kbd>authority_files.xml</kbd> in the

      <h3>How do I make MerMEId recognize other abbreviations?<a name="add_abbreviations"></a></h3>
      <p>The same way you would <a href="#customize_instruments">change pre-defined instruments
        names</a>. Look for the file <kbd>abbreviations.xml</kbd> in the 
        <a href="/storage/library/"><kbd>library</kbd></a> folder.</p>
      <h3>How do I change the genre keywords in the 'Keywords' menu?<a name="change_genres"
        ></a></h3>
      <p>The same way you would <a href="faq.html#customize_instruments">change pre-defined
      instruments names</a>. The keyword file (<kbd>keywords.xml</kbd>) is located in the 
        <a href="/storage/library/"><kbd>library</kbd></a> folder. It has two sections:
        first,&nbsp;a list of hierarchically ordered keywords (called 'level 1' and 'level 2'
        terms); second,&nbsp;a list of unordered supplementary keywords. The two-level ordered list
        of genre terms is useful if you intend to order your files by genre at some point or enable
        users to browse your catalogue by genre. That's how we generated the genre menu in the <a
          href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html" target="_blank">CNW</a>.</p>
      <h3>What else can I customize?<a name="customizations"></a></h3>
      <p> Various lists of pre-defined values are placed in the <a href="/storage/library/"><kbd>library</kbd></a> folder of the
        eXist database to make them easily customizable. Apart from those mentioned above, the lists
        include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Source classification values</li>
        <li>Instrument groups (for quickly inserting a number of instruments)</li>
        <li>Languages</li>
        <li>Relators (the relation of a person to the artefact). The list is based on the <a
            href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html" target="_blank">MARC code list
            for relators</a>. You may want to extend or change it, however.</li>
        <li>Image resolutions for incipit graphics. These can have any values, but please notice
          that MerMEId's HTML output recognizes only values "lowres" and "hires" (for low and high
          resolution images, respectively).</li>
        <li>Writing medium. The list is really just a menu offering some frequently used values for
          easy copying into the corresponding input field. I does not impose any restrictions on the
          values you may enter in the editor. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Publishing</h2>
      <h3>I have published a file from the file list, but nothing happens&nbsp;except that the
        'Publish' indicator turns green. What is supposed to happen?<a name="publishing"></a></h3>
      <p>There's no way we can predict how and where you want to publish your data. By default,
        therefore,&nbsp;MerMEId does nothing but copying the selected file(s) from an eXist database
        folder&nbsp;named 'dcm' (where all your data are stored) to another folder&nbsp;named
        'public'. It is up to you or your system administrator to decide what is going to happen
        next. At DCM, we have set up a script that automatically copies all files from the 'public'
        folder through the firewall to the published catalog on the web once a day. The script is
        not part of MerMEId, but you are welcome to contact us if you would like to know in detail
        how it works. </p>
      <h3>I would like to make a web catalog like the CNW. Is the user interface included in
          MerMEId?<a name="cnw_ui"></a></h3>
      <p>No. MerMEId is&nbsp;a tool for creating and editing the XML data for a catalogue of works
        or sources, not a presentation tool. We're quite sure that every project will want to have
        their data presented in their own way, so we haven't made our presentation part of MerMEId.
        To create the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html" target="_blank">public CNW</a>
        catalogue, we basically use MerMEId's&nbsp;MEI-to-HTML transformation, and add a few
        exceptions and alterations on top of it. We have&nbsp;added a few XQuery&nbsp;files for the
        search facilities and a couple of flat HTML files for the text-only pages. A few more XQuery
        scripts wrap the pages with a header and a footer. The code is available as a separate
        project at <a href="https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/dcm_catalog_ui"
          target="_blank">GitHub</a>. </p>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <h3>How do I stay informed about changes and updates?<a name="updates"></a></h3>
      <p>We recommend that you sign up for MerMEId news. There's a subscription form at <a
          href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/projekter/mermeid.html" target="_blank">DCM's MerMEId
          project page</a> (in the right column). Don't worry – we will not flood your inbox with
        mails. We will send a mail only when releasing major upgrades or if there are other
        important MerMEId-related&nbsp;announcements. <br /> A list of important information about
        releases,&nbsp;transformation of data, and known issues is compiled at <a
          href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/projekter/mermeid/" target="_blank"
          >http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/projekter/mermeid/</a>.<br /> Finally, you may also want to
        follow the discussions about the development of the MEI schema&nbsp;which defines the
        structure of the (meta-)data produced by MerMEId. The MEI community even has a <a
          href="http://music-encoding.org/community/mei-organization/interest-groups-ig/"
          target="_blank">special interest group concerned with cataloging and metadata</a> with its
        own mailing list where discussions regarding the encoding of musical metadata take place.
        Important MerMEId&nbsp;announcements will be posted there as well.</p>
